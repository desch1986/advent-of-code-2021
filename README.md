# advent-of-code-2021
My contributions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/)!

This year I want to enter uncharted terrain (for me) and get in touch with **functional programming** and the **Elixir** programming language. The latter caught my eye some time ago when visiting a usergroup hosted by a former colleague of mine. Never found the time to give it a proper try.
